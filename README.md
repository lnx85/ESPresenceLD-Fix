# ESPresence
ESPHome firmware for ESPresenceLD sensor (ESP32+LD2410x)

# Prerequisites
Installing **ESPHome** on hardware with a minimum of 2GB of RAM (4GB is recommended) is crucial, otherwise it may not be able to compile the firmware properly.
The setup process of your **Home Assistant** can be smoother with *Bluetooth* enabled, as it autodiscovers, adopts, and compiles the latest firmware available.

# Installation
Read PDF file in repository --> **ESPresence-LD2410-Install.pdf**

# Factory Reset
If you want to bring your device to the initial conditions please follow below steps:
1) download the loader firmware from this repository -- **espresenceld.bin**
2) connect your device to PC with USB cable and flash the firmware just downloaded using **ESPHome Flasher** tool
3) Now the device is in the initial condition and you can install it following the instructions
   
# Hardware
This firmware is suitable for my ESPresence device based on ESP32-WROOM-32D microcontroller and LD2410C presence sensor.
You can purchase this device using the link in the next section. 
| GPIO  | Assigned Function |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| IO18  | LD24x0 TX Pin  |
| IO33  | LD24x0 RX Pin  |
| IO13  | Status LED (Green) used by ESPHome  |
| IO23  | Disable Occupancy LED (Red)  |
| IO34  | LDR for analog luminosity reading  |
| IO25  | ICS Bus - SCL or SDA Pin  |
| IO26  | ICS Bus - SDA or SCL Pin  |

NOTE: in **I2C_device folder** you can find example code for tested I2C sensor; you can simply copy and paste them at the end of the YAML code of your ESPresenceLD device and recompile the firmware.
